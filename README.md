We used computational and experimental approaches for the differential occupancy and regulatory interaction profile of KDM6A in normal, immortal and cancer bladder cell lines in this study.

**Our abstract;**

Epigenetic deregulation is a critical theme which needs further investigation in bladder cancer research. One of the most highly mutated genes in bladder cancer is KDM6A, which functions as an H3K27 demethylase and is one of the MLL3/4 complexes. 
To decipher the role of KDM6A in normal versus tumor settings, we identified the genomic landscape of KDM6A in normal, immortalized, and cancerous bladder cells. Our results showed differential KDM6A occupancy in the genes involved in cell differentiation, 
chromatin organization, and Notch signaling depending on the cell type and the mutation status of KDM6A. Transcription factor motif analysis revealed HES1 to be enriched at KDM6A peaks identified in the T24 bladder cancer cell line; moreover, it has a 
truncating mutation in KDM6A and lacks a demethylase domain. Our co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed TLE co-repressors and HES1 as potential truncated and wild-type KDM6A interactors. With the aid of structural modeling, we explored how truncated 
KDM6A could interact with TLE and HES1, as well as RUNX and HHEX transcription factors. These structures provide a solid means of studying the functions of KDM6A independently of its demethylase activity. Collectively, our work provides important 
contributions to the understanding of KDM6A malfunction in bladder cancer.

In this study, we mapped the localization profile of KDM6A in normal, immortal and tumor bladder cell lines. Our analysis revealed differential binding profile of KDM6A and corresponding associations with the pathways involved in chromatin organization and Notch signaling in the analyzed cell lines, and  differential transcription factor enrichment profiles.  Among the bladder cancer cell lines analyzed in our study, T24 cell line, has a stop gain mutation in KDM6A, giving rise to a truncated protein product. Especially analysis of KDM6A binding profiles in this mutant cell line gave interesting insights about the association of truncated KDM6A with the genes deregulated in cancer. We identified HES1 transcription factor motifs to be enriched at KDM6A peaks called in T24 cell line and also in other KDM6A-occupied clusters. We were able to experimentally show the interaction of KDM6A with HES1 and its closely associated partner functioning as co-repressor, TLE1 by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Further, we computationally simulated the interaction concerning the KDM6A-TLE1-HES1 triangle using structural modeling. 

**Importance of our study**
To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing the occupancy of KDM6A in normal, immortalized and cancer bladder cells with endogenous mutation in KDM6A and, for the first time highlighting the association of KDM6A with TLE1 and HES1. We think that our findings contribute substantially to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with KDM6A function and its interacting protein partners.
